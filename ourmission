  <h1>üìå MyHotPicks ‚Äì Global Independent Voting by Fans</h1>
  <p><strong>MyHotPicks</strong> is an independent and global fan platform created to give voice to the audience ‚Äî the fans ‚Äî in the world of beauty pageants.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üí¨ Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To celebrate, highlight and value the work of candidates, organizations, and sponsors, through free and democratic fan participation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üéØ How it works</h2>
    <p>Each registered user of the platform selects <strong>10 candidates</strong> from any competition and ranks them in order of preference.</p>
    <p>Each position awards a specific number of points:</p>

    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr><th>Position</th><th>Points Given</th></tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr><td>1st place</td><td>11 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>2nd place</td><td>10 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>3rd place</td><td>8 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>4th place</td><td>7 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>5th place</td><td>6 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>6th place</td><td>5 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>7th place</td><td>4 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>8th place</td><td>3 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>9th place</td><td>2 pts</td></tr>
        <tr><td>10th place</td><td>1 pt</td></tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>‚ûû <strong>Total fan points distributed per user: 57 pts</strong></p>
    <p>These points are stored securely and used to create a <strong>global ranking</strong> of candidates based solely on how the public perceives their performance and preparation.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üåê Independence & Transparency</h2>
    <p>MyHotPicks is <strong>not affiliated</strong> with any official pageant organization, judge panel, or sponsor. We are a <strong>completely independent, fan-created platform</strong>. Our only objective is to give fans a tool to be heard.</p>
    <p>This is not a prediction game. It is not betting. It is not a contest. It is <strong>pure, open, transparent admiration</strong> expressed by the global audience.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>‚ù§Ô∏è A Call to Unity, Participation, and Celebration</h2>
    <p>We believe fans are a vital part of every pageant. We follow every candidate, we watch the rehearsals, we support the brands and sponsors, we observe every stage of the competition ‚Äî and we feel connected.</p>
    <blockquote><em>We are the ones who watch. We are the ones who care. We are the ones who cheer.</em></blockquote>
    <p>This platform exists to bring us together as <strong>one global fan voice</strong> ‚Äî a voice that recognizes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The hard work of every candidate</li>
      <li>The effort and organization behind each show</li>
      <li>The companies and sponsors who support them</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üëë Respect for the Official Crown</h2>
    <p>We fully respect the decisions of the official organizations. We celebrate every crowned queen, and we understand that there are many elements behind each final result ‚Äî technical, organizational, cultural, economic. That is part of the process.</p>
    <p>But as fans, we also want to admire and highlight what we see. We want to celebrate the journey, the presence, the preparation ‚Äî and express our admiration publicly. <strong>Not to oppose, but to complement the official decisions.</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üß≠ Why this matters</h2>
    <p>MyHotPicks is <strong>inclusive and open to everyone</strong> ‚Äî regardless of country, language, or income. Anyone can vote. Everyone‚Äôs voice counts equally.</p>
    <p>We believe that fan appreciation is a reflection of the impact these women make in the real world, and that our collective ranking can offer a new lens through which the world sees their work.</p>
    <p>We want our admiration to travel beyond the screen. We want candidates to feel <strong>seen, celebrated, and valued</strong> by the audience that follows them most closely.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>üó≥Ô∏è Final Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>One global ranking, built democratically</li>
      <li>57 points per user, distributed freely</li>
      <li>Votes based only on merit and admiration</li>
      <li>No external influence, no payment required</li>
      <li>Full respect for the official pageants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This is not about changing the result. It's about expressing how we felt watching the competition, and recognizing candidates who moved us, inspired us, and gave their all.</p>
    <p><strong>This is our way to celebrate them.</strong></p>
    <h3>‚ú® We are MyHotPicks. We are the fans. And we finally have our voice.</h3>
